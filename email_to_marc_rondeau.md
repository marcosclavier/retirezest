Dear Marc,

I hope this email finds you well. We wanted to reach out to let you know about some significant improvements we've made to RetireZest based on user feedback, including enhancements that we believe will be particularly valuable for your retirement planning.

## What's New

We've made several important updates to better handle private pensions and improve the overall accuracy of retirement simulations:

### Enhanced Private Pension Support
- **Improved pension calculations** that properly account for employer pensions in all tax and benefit calculations
- **Inflation indexing options** for private pensions - you can now specify whether your pension is indexed to inflation or remains fixed
- **Better integration** with government benefits (CPP, OAS, GIS) to ensure accurate benefit eligibility calculations
- **Clearer labeling** and guidance throughout the pension input process

### Additional Improvements
- Fixed calculation issues where high pension income was incorrectly qualifying for GIS benefits
- Enhanced TFSA contribution room tracking and surplus allocation
- Improved guidance for CPP and OAS estimates, with links to both RetireZest calculators and CRA resources
- More accurate year-by-year cash flow projections

## We'd Love Your Feedback
