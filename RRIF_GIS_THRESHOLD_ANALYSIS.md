# RRIF Balance Thresholds for GIS Eligibility

## Executive Summary

**Yes, there is a critical RRIF balance threshold where mandatory minimums make GIS impossible.**

For most scenarios, if RRIF balance exceeds **$90-130K** (singles) or **$25K total** (couples), GIS eligibility will be lost at age 71+ due to mandatory minimum withdrawals.

---

## The Problem

At age 71, Canadian tax law requires:
1. **RRSP must convert to RRIF** (mandatory)
2. **RRIF minimum withdrawals** become mandatory (cannot avoid)
3. **RRIF withdrawals are 100% taxable** income

When RRIF minimums + CPP + OAS > GIS threshold → **No GIS eligibility**

## RRIF Balance Thresholds by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Single Person - Low CPP/OAS
**Profile:**
- CPP: $8,000
- OAS: $7,500
- **Base income: $15,500**
- GIS threshold: $22,272
- **Income room: $6,772**

**Maximum RRIF Balance to Maintain GIS:**

| Age | RRIF Min % | Max RRIF Balance | Annual Minimum | GIS Status |
|-----|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| 65  | 4.00%     | **$169,300**     | $6,772         | ✓ GIS viable |
| 70  | 5.00%     | **$135,440**     | $6,772         | ✓ GIS viable |
| **71** | **5.28%** | **$128,258** | **$6,772**     | **✓ Critical threshold** |
| 75  | 5.82%     | **$116,357**     | $6,772         | ✓ GIS viable |
| 80  | 6.82%     | $99,296          | $6,772         | ⚠️ Marginal |

**Conclusion:**
- ✅ If RRIF ≤ $130K: GIS eligibility maintained through age 75+
- ❌ If RRIF > $130K: GIS lost at age 71+

### Scenario 2: Single Person - Average CPP/OAS
**Profile:**
- CPP: $10,000
- OAS: $7,500
- **Base income: $17,500**
- GIS threshold: $22,272
- **Income room: $4,772**

**Maximum RRIF Balance to Maintain GIS:**

| Age | RRIF Min % | Max RRIF Balance | Annual Minimum | GIS Status |
|-----|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| 65  | 4.00%     | **$119,300**     | $4,772         | ✓ GIS viable |
| 70  | 5.00%     | **$95,440**      | $4,772         | ⚠️ Marginal |
| **71** | **5.28%** | **$90,379**  | **$4,772**     | **⚠️ Critical threshold** |
| 75  | 5.82%     | $81,993          | $4,772         | ⚠️ Low |
| 80  | 6.82%     | $69,971          | $4,772         | ⚠️ Very low |

**Conclusion:**
- ✅ If RRIF ≤ $90K: GIS eligibility maintained through age 70
- ❌ If RRIF > $90K: GIS lost at age 71+

---

### Scenario 3: Couple (Both with OAS) - Low CPP
**Profile:**
- Combined CPP: $16,000 ($8K each)
- Combined OAS: $14,000 ($7K each)
- **Base income: $30,000**
- GIS threshold (couple): $30,613
- **Income room: $613** ⚠️ Very tight!

**Maximum RRIF Balance to Maintain GIS:**

| Age | RRIF Min % | Max RRIF Balance (TOTAL) | Annual Minimum | GIS Status |
|-----|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|------------|
| 65  | 4.00%     | $15,325                  | $613           | ⚠️ Too low |
| 70  | 5.00%     | $12,260                  | $613           | ⚠️ Too low |
| **71** | **5.28%** | **$11,610**          | **$613**       | **⚠️ Essentially zero** |
| 75  | 5.82%     | $10,533                  | $613           | ⚠️ Negligible |

**Conclusion:**
- ❌ Couples with both on OAS have **MINIMAL GIS room** (~$600/year)
- ❌ Max combined RRIF: ~$25K total ($12.5K each)
- ❌ **GIS strategy NOT viable** for couples with even modest RRIFs

---

### Scenario 4: Couple (Both with OAS) - Average CPP
**Profile (Rafael & Lucy Test Scenario):**
- Combined CPP: $20,000 ($10K each)
- Combined OAS: $14,000 ($7K each)
- **Base income: $34,000**
- GIS threshold (couple): $30,613
- **Income room: -$3,387** ❌ NEGATIVE

**Conclusion:**
- ❌ **NO GIS ELIGIBILITY** at all
- Base income (CPP+OAS alone) exceeds GIS threshold
- RRIF balance is irrelevant - already ineligible
- **This is the Rafael & Lucy scenario** - only 6 years of GIS in early ages

## Summary Table: RRIF Thresholds

| Client Profile | Max RRIF at Age 71 | GIS Viability | Strategy Recommendation |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Single - Low CPP** | **~$128K** | ✓ Good | Use minimize-income strategy |
| **Single - Avg CPP** | **~$90K** | ⚠️ Marginal | Consider early RRIF depletion |
| **Couple - Low CPP** | **~$25K total** | ⚠️ Minimal | GIS likely not worth optimizing |
| **Couple - Avg CPP** | **N/A** | ❌ Ineligible | Use different strategy |

---

## Why This Happens

### The Math:
1. **GIS threshold (single)**: $22,272
2. **Typical CPP+OAS**: $15,500 - $17,500
3. **Income room**: $4,772 - $6,772

4. **RRIF minimum at 71**: 5.28%
5. **Max RRIF = Income room ÷ 5.28%**
   - Low income: $6,772 ÷ 5.28% = **$128K max**
   - Avg income: $4,772 ÷ 5.28% = **$90K max**

6. **If RRIF > threshold**: Mandatory minimum exceeds income room → GIS lost

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### For RRIF < Threshold (GIS Viable):

✅ **Use "minimize-income" strategy**
- TFSA prioritized to preserve GIS
- NonReg used strategically (only 50% taxable)
- Corp dividends minimized
- RRIF minimum only
- **Expected GIS benefit**: $100-200K over lifetime

### For RRIF > Threshold (GIS NOT Viable):

⚠️ **Early RRIF Depletion (Before Age 71)**
1. Convert RRSP to RRIF at age 65-70 (voluntary)
2. Make voluntary RRIF withdrawals while minimums are lower
3. Deplete RRIF strategically:
   - Age 65: 4.00% minimum
   - Age 70: 5.00% minimum
   - **vs. Age 71+: 5.28%+** (mandatory and increasing)
4. Transfer funds to TFSA (if room available)
5. Use NonReg/Corp for spending

**Goal**: Reduce RRIF to below threshold by age 71

### Alternative Strategies if GIS Not Viable:

1. **"RRIF-Frontload with OAS Protection"** - Deplete RRIF early, protect OAS
2. **"Balanced (Optimized for tax efficiency)"** - Balance all sources
3. **"Corp->RRIF->NonReg->TFSA"** - For corporate-heavy portfolios

## Rafael & Lucy Case Study

**Why GIS is Limited ($17,687 total):**

```
Ages 65-66 (Rafael only on OAS):
  Rafael: CPP=$10K + OAS=$7K + RRIF min=$12K = $29K
  Lucy: CPP=$0 + OAS=$0 + RRIF min=$10.5K = $10.5K
  Combined: $39.5K
  Threshold (one OAS): $53,808
  → ✓ GIS eligible (reduced)

Ages 67-70 (both on OAS, before RRIF mandatory):
  Combined CPP+OAS: $34K
  RRIF minimums: ~$25K (voluntary)
  Combined: ~$59K
  Threshold (both OAS): $30,613
  → ⚠️ Marginal GIS eligibility

Ages 71+ (RRIF mandatory):
  Combined CPP+OAS: $34K
  RRIF minimums: $31,680 (5.28% × $600K)
  Combined: $65,680
  Threshold: $30,613
  → ❌ NO GIS (exceeds by 2.14x)
```

**Result**: Only 6 years of GIS ($17,687 total)

This is **CORRECT BEHAVIOR** - the strategy is working as intended, but the client profile doesn't fit the GIS optimization model.

## Best GIS Optimization Candidates

✅ **Ideal Profile:**
- CPP: $6,000 - $8,000 (low)
- OAS: $7,000 - $7,500 (full)
- RRIF: $50,000 - $120,000 (modest)
- TFSA: $100,000+ (high)
- NonReg/Corp: $200,000+ (available for strategic withdrawals)
- Spending: $40,000 - $60,000/year (modest)

✅ **Expected GIS Benefit**: $150,000 - $250,000 over lifetime

❌ **Poor GIS Candidates:**
- CPP: $10,000+ (average/high)
- RRIF: $300,000+ (large)
- Spending: $100,000+ (high)

❌ **Expected GIS Benefit**: Minimal or zero

## Action Items for Advisors

### 1. **Pre-Retirement (Age 60-70)**
- Calculate client's RRIF threshold
- If RRIF > threshold, plan early depletion strategy
- Maximize TFSA contributions while working
- Consider RRSP-to-RRIF conversion at 65 (voluntary)

### 2. **Early Retirement (Age 65-70)**
- Implement voluntary RRIF withdrawals
- Transfer to TFSA (if room available)
- Use GIS calculator to validate eligibility
- Switch to minimize-income strategy if eligible

### 3. **Age 71+ (RRIF Mandatory)**
- Re-evaluate GIS eligibility
- If RRIF minimums push income over threshold:
  - Accept GIS loss (unavoidable)
  - Switch to tax-efficiency focused strategy
  - Focus on OAS preservation instead

---

## Conclusion

**The answer to your question: YES**

There is a **critical RRIF balance threshold** (~$90-130K for singles, ~$25K for couples) where mandatory minimum withdrawals make GIS impossible at age 71+.

**Key Takeaway:**
- The minimize-income strategy **works correctly** but **cannot overcome RRIF minimums** when balances are too high
- **Best GIS candidates**: Low CPP, small-medium RRIF, high TFSA
- **Poor GIS candidates**: Average CPP, large RRIF (like Rafael & Lucy)

The strategy should be recommended based on **client-specific RRIF thresholds**, not as a one-size-fits-all solution.
