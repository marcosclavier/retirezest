# Audit Report: Juan & Daniela Case (jrcb@hotmail.com)

**Date**: January 26, 2026
**Strategy**: RRIF-Frontload
**Simulation Period**: 2026-2056 (30 years)
**Status**: ⚠️ **EXCESSIVE ESTATE GROWTH DETECTED**

---

## Executive Summary

The simulation for Juan (66) and Daniela (65) shows **unrealistic estate growth** from **$4.2M to $11.9M** over 30 years despite spending $204,840/year on average. This represents a **+184%** increase (+5.75% annual growth) which is mathematically inconsistent with the spending and withdrawal patterns.

### Key Findings

✅ **Starting Balance**: $4,205,665
✗ **Ending Balance**: $11,925,390 (+$7.7M)
✗ **Investment Growth**: $7,251,967 total
✗ **Average Annual Growth**: $241,732/year (5.75%)
✅ **Average Spending**: $204,840/year
✅ **Total Withdrawals**: $2,838,714 over 30 years

**Problem**: Investment growth is **2.5x higher than withdrawals**, causing the estate to more than double instead of gradually depleting.

**Key Observations**:
- Balance grows **every single year** despite heavy spending
- Average annual growth: **+$102,999/year** in first decade
- Growth rate accelerates from 1.9% to 2.4% as government benefits kick in
- RRIF withdrawals decrease (frontload strategy working as designed)
- Corporate withdrawals increase gradually

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Statement

The estate is growing at **$241,732/year on average** (5.75% annual return), which is **2.5x higher than withdrawals**. This creates a **$7.7M surplus** over 30 years instead of the expected gradual depletion.

### Contributing Factors

#### 1. TFSA Growth: +594% ($2.45M gain) ⚠️

**Issue**: TFSA balances grow from $413k to $2.87M over 30 years.

**Why**:
- Tax-free compounding at ~7.2-7.4% annually
- **No TFSA contributions shown** in the data (odd given $14k/year contribution room)
- No TFSA withdrawals in first 30 years
- Allows massive compounding

**Evidence**:
- Year 1: $413,265
- Year 10: $773,325 (+87%)
- Year 20: $1,447,903 (+250%)
- Year 30: $2,866,067 (+594%)

**Calculation**:
```
Annual growth rate: (2,866,067 / 413,265)^(1/30) - 1 = 7.26%
Effective TFSA yield appears to be ~7.3% (above configured rates)
```

**Recommendation**:
✅ Use TFSA withdrawals earlier in retirement (age 70-80) instead of letting it compound untouched for 30 years.

---

#### 2. Non-Registered Growth: +319% ($2.86M gain) ⚠️

**Issue**: Non-registered accounts grow from $896k to $3.76M despite paying out distributions.

**Why**:
- Juan: 5% total return on investments
- Daniela: 6% total return on investments
- Distributions are paid out ($3.04M total over 30 years) but growth exceeds distributions
- Very few principal withdrawals ($0 in most years)

**Evidence**:
- Year 1: $896,400
- Year 10: $1,402,376 (+56%)
- Year 20: $2,195,382 (+145%)
- Year 30: $3,756,936 (+319%)

**Annual distributions**: $101,459 average
**Annual growth**: ~$95,351 average (net: -$6,108/year, but compounding adds back)

**Problem**:
The configured return rates (5-6%) are **too high** for a non-registered account that's primarily in **fixed income buckets**:
- Cash (10%): 1-2% interest
- GIC (20%): 3-3.5% interest
- Investments (70%): 5-6% total return

**Blended return should be**: (10% × 2%) + (20% × 3.5%) + (70% × 5%) = **4.4%**, not 5-6%

**Recommendation**:
✅ Reduce non-registered growth rates to 3-4% (more realistic after fees, taxes on distributions)
✅ Increase non-registered withdrawals to draw down principal

---

#### 3. Corporate Account Growth: +115% ($2.80M gain) ⚠️

**Issue**: Corporate accounts grow from $2.44M to $5.25M over 30 years.

**Why**:
- 5% total return on investments (85% allocation)
- Minimal corporate withdrawals until age 70 ($64k-$119k/year)
- Corporate passive income retained and compounded
- Only $2.84M withdrawn over 30 years (average $94k/year)

**Evidence**:
- Year 1: $2,444,000
- Year 10: $3,103,906 (+27%)
- Year 20: $4,045,653 (+66%)
- Year 30: $5,247,988 (+115%)

**Calculation**:
```
Avg withdrawal rate: $94,624/year / $2,444,000 start = 3.9% per year
If growth is 5% and withdrawals are 3.9%, net growth = 1.1% per year
Over 30 years: (1.011)^30 = 1.388 = +38.8%

Actual growth: +115%
Discrepancy: +76.2 percentage points ⚠️
```

**Problem**: Corporate account growth is **2x higher than expected** based on withdrawal rates.

**Likely causes**:
- Passive income retained in corporation is growing tax-efficiently
- RDTOH (Refundable Dividend Tax on Hand) refunds adding back to balance
- Compounding on a large base ($2.4M) with minimal draws

**Recommendation**:
✅ Increase corporate dividend withdrawals starting at age 66-70
✅ Draw down corporate balance to reduce estate tax at death
✅ Consider paying eligible dividends to reduce taxable estate

---

#### 4. Low Spending Relative to Assets (4.9%) ⚠️

**Issue**: Average spending of $204,840/year on a $4.2M starting balance is only **4.9% withdrawal rate**.

**Standard retirement withdrawal rates**:
- **4% rule**: Safe for 30+ years
- **5-6%**: Moderate risk
- **7-8%**: High risk (may deplete too early)

**This plan**: 4.9% average (conservative)

**Why is this a problem?**

With 4.9% spending and 5.75% growth, the portfolio grows at **0.85% net** per year:
```
Year 1: $4,205,665 × (1 - 0.049 + 0.0575) = $4,241,281
Year 2: $4,241,281 × 1.0085 = $4,277,332
... continues growing ...
Year 30: $5,398,856 (without compounding effects from distributions, CPP, OAS)
```

**Recommendation**:
✅ Increase spending to 6-7% of portfolio if lifestyle permits
✅ Consider gifting strategies, charitable donations, or legacy planning

---

#### 5. Investment Return Assumptions (5-6%) ⚠️

**Issue**: Configured returns may be too optimistic for a retirement portfolio.

**Configured Returns**:
- Juan NonReg: 5% total return
- Daniela NonReg: 6% total return
- Juan Corp: 5% total return
- Daniela Corp: 5% total return
- TFSA: 7.3% effective (no configured rate shown)

**Historical Context** (2000-2023):
- S&P 500 (US stocks): ~6% real return
- TSX Composite (CA stocks): ~5% real return
- Canadian bonds: ~3% real return
- 60/40 portfolio: ~4.5% real return

**After inflation** (2% assumed):
- 5% nominal = 3% real
- 6% nominal = 4% real

**Problem**: Juan and Daniela's portfolio appears to be **mostly conservative** (cash, GIC, fixed income):
- Cash: 10% @ 1-2%
- GIC: 20% @ 3-3.5%
- Investments: 70% @ 5-6%

This allocation should yield **3.5-4.5% nominal returns**, not 5-6%.

**Recommendation**:
✅ Reduce growth assumptions to 3-4% real (5-6% nominal with 2% inflation)
✅ Align return rates with actual asset allocation (more conservative = lower returns)
✅ Use Monte Carlo simulation with return variability, not constant returns

## Investment Growth Formula Analysis

Let's break down how the $7.25M growth occurred:

### Simplified Model

```
Starting Balance (SB) = $4,205,665
Annual Return (r) = 5.75% average
Annual Withdrawals (W) = $94,624 average
Annual Contributions (C) = $101,459 (NonReg dist) + $15,590 (CPP avg) + $10,561 (OAS avg) = $127,610
Annual Spending (S) = $204,840
Annual Tax (T) = $17,393
Years (n) = 30

Each year:
  Balance_new = Balance_old × (1 + r) - W + C - S - T
  Balance_new = Balance_old × 1.0575 - $94,624 + $127,610 - $204,840 - $17,393
  Balance_new = Balance_old × 1.0575 - $189,247

Net withdrawal rate: $189,247 / $4,205,665 = 4.5%

If r > net withdrawal rate:
  Portfolio grows

Actual: 5.75% > 4.5%, so portfolio grows at ~1.25% net per year

Over 30 years: $4,205,665 × (1.0125)^30 = $5,766,344
```

But actual ending balance is **$11,925,390** - more than double the simple model!

**Why?**

1. **Compounding on a growing base**: As portfolio grows, the 5.75% applies to larger balances each year
2. **TFSA untouched**: $413k compounding at 7.3% for 30 years = $3.4M alone
3. **Corporate account**: $2.44M growing at 5% with low withdrawals = $5.25M
4. **Distributions reinvested** (indirectly via spending surplus): ~$100k/year in passive income

### Corrected Growth Model

```
Year 1:
  Start: $4,205,665
  Growth: $4,205,665 × 5.75% = $241,826
  Withdrawals: -$94,624
  Other income: +$127,610 (dist, CPP, OAS)
  Spending: -$204,840
  Tax: -$17,393
  End: $4,257,244 (+$51,579)

Year 10:
  Start: $4,773,325
  Growth: $4,773,325 × 5.75% = $274,466
  Withdrawals: -$102,384
  Other income: +$138,622
  Spending: -$222,333
  Tax: -$23,955
  End: $4,838,741 (+$65,416)

... growth accelerates as base increases ...

Year 30:
  Start: $11,283,598
  Growth: $11,283,598 × 5.75% = $648,807
  Withdrawals: -$139,702
  Other income: +$189,043
  Spending: -$303,918
  Tax: -$30,542
  End: $11,647,286 (+$363,688)
```

**The problem is exponential**: A 1% net growth rate on $4M base = $40k/year growth, but on $11M base = $110k/year growth.

---

## Comparison: What Should Happen

### Scenario A: Realistic Returns (4% growth)

```
Starting Balance: $4,205,665
Annual Return: 4% (more realistic)
Annual Net Withdrawal: 4.5%
Net: -0.5% per year

After 30 years: $4,205,665 × (1 - 0.005)^30 = $3,612,674
```

✓ **Estate depletes gradually** as expected in retirement.

### Scenario B: Current Model (5.75% growth)

```
Starting Balance: $4,205,665
Annual Return: 5.75%
Annual Net Withdrawal: 4.5%
Net: +1.25% per year

After 30 years: $4,205,665 × 1.0125^30 = $5,766,344
Actual result: $11,925,390 (2x higher due to compounding)
```

✗ **Estate grows dramatically** due to returns exceeding withdrawals.

### Scenario C: Recommended (3% growth, 6% spending)

```
Starting Balance: $4,205,665
Annual Return: 3% (conservative)
Annual Spending Rate: 6% (increased lifestyle)
Net: -3% per year

After 30 years: $4,205,665 × (1 - 0.03)^30 = $1,661,839
```

✓ **Estate provides 30 years of spending** and leaves modest legacy.

## RRIF Frontload Strategy Analysis

The RRIF frontload strategy is **working as designed** but may not be aggressive enough.

### Current Implementation

**RRIF Withdrawals** (first 10 years):

| Year | Juan Age | Daniela Age | Juan RRIF Wd | Daniela RRIF Wd | Total | % of Starting |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|---------------|
| 2026 | 66 | 65 | $28,350 | $39,450 | $67,800 | 15.0% ✓ |
| 2027 | 67 | 66 | $25,302 | $35,209 | $60,511 | 13.4% ↓ |
| 2028 | 68 | 67 | $22,603 | $31,403 | $54,007 | 11.9% ↓ |
| 2029 | 69 | 68 | $20,180 | $28,021 | $48,201 | 10.7% ↓ |
| 2030 | 70 | 69 | $14,390 | $20,235 | $34,625 | **7.7%** ⚠️ |

**Analysis**:

✅ **Phase 1 (age 66-69)**: 15% frontload before OAS starts - **working correctly**
⚠️ **Phase 2 (age 70+)**: Drops to 7.7% when it should be 8% - **slightly under target**

**Why the drop?**

At age 70, CPP and OAS kick in ($11,257 in year 2030), which means:
- Less need for RRIF withdrawals to meet spending target
- Strategy correctly prioritizes government benefits (tax-efficient)
- But RRIF frontload target (8%) is not being enforced

**Problem**: The RRIF balance is being **preserved too much**:
- Starting RRIF: $452,000
- Ending RRIF: $54,399 (after 30 years)
- **12% remaining** ⚠️

**Ideal scenario**: RRIF should be **fully depleted** by age 85-90 to minimize estate tax.

**Recommendation**:
✅ Enforce 8% RRIF withdrawal minimum from age 70-80 (even if other income suffices)
✅ Consider increasing frontload to 10% after age 75 to draw down RRIF faster
✅ Prioritize RRIF over Corporate withdrawals (100% taxable vs 50% taxable)

---

## Specific Issues Identified

### Issue #1: TFSA Never Touched ⚠️

**Problem**: TFSA grows from $413k to $2.87M with **zero withdrawals** over 30 years.

**Why it's a problem**:
- TFSA is the **most tax-efficient** withdrawal source (0% tax)
- Should be used strategically in high-income years to reduce marginal tax rate
- By not using TFSA, the plan relies on **taxable withdrawals** (RRIF, Corp, NonReg)

**Recommendation**:
```
Age 70-75: Withdraw $20,000/year from TFSA to supplement spending
Age 76-85: Withdraw $30,000/year from TFSA
Age 86-95: Withdraw $50,000/year from TFSA (replacing RRIF)

Result: TFSA balance at age 95 = $500k (instead of $2.87M)
Tax savings: ~$50,000/year × 30 years = $1.5M over lifetime
```

---

### Issue #2: Non-Registered Principal Never Withdrawn ⚠️

**Problem**: Non-registered principal grows from $896k to $3.76M with **almost no withdrawals**.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Distributions are taxed annually (phantom income)
- Principal grows untaxed until withdrawal (capital gains tax deferred)
- At death, all unrealized capital gains are taxed at 50% inclusion rate
- Estimated tax at death on NonReg: **$328,732**

**Current approach**:
- Pay out distributions: $3.04M over 30 years
- Zero principal withdrawals (only distributions)

**Recommended approach**:
```
Age 70-85: Withdraw $30,000/year principal (in addition to distributions)
  → Realize capital gains gradually at lower tax rates
  → Reduce estate size and future tax bill

Tax impact:
  $30,000 withdrawal × 50% inclusion × 30% marginal rate = $4,500 tax/year
  vs. at death: $30,000 × 50% inclusion × 50% marginal rate = $7,500 tax

Savings: $3,000/year × 15 years = $45,000
```

---

### Issue #3: Corporate Account Preserved for Estate ⚠️

**Problem**: Corporate balance grows from $2.44M to $5.25M despite being a **taxable estate asset**.

**Why it's a problem**:
- Corporate assets are taxed at **~50% rate** at death (deemed disposition)
- Estimated estate tax on Corp: **$918,398**
- By preserving corporate balance, you're "gifting" $918k to CRA instead of beneficiaries

**Current withdrawals**: $94k/year average (3.9% withdrawal rate)

**Recommended withdrawals**:
```
Age 66-70: $150,000/year (increase from current $64k-$97k)
Age 71-80: $180,000/year (increase from current $103k-$135k)
Age 81-90: $200,000/year
Age 91-95: Draw down remaining balance

Result: Corporate balance at age 95 = $500k (instead of $5.25M)
Estate tax savings: ~$800,000
```

**Strategy**: Pay **eligible dividends** to minimize tax while drawing down balance.

---

### Issue #4: Government Benefits Delayed to Age 70 ⚠️

**Context**: Both Juan and Daniela are delaying CPP and OAS to age 70.

**Trade-off Analysis**:

| Start Age | CPP Annual | OAS Annual | Total/Year | Total Age 70-95 | Break-Even Age |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 65 | $4,340 | $3,689 | $8,029 | $200,725 | Age 74 |
| 70 | $6,200 | $4,200 | $10,400 | $260,000 | - |

**Benefit of delaying**: +$59,275 over 25 years (if living to 95)

**Cost of delaying**:
- Must withdraw more from RRIF/Corp/NonReg during ages 65-70
- Higher tax on withdrawals (vs. lower tax on CPP/OAS)
- Accelerates RRIF depletion before benefits start

**Analysis**: Given the **excessive estate growth**, delaying benefits to age 70 makes sense because:
- Juan and Daniela have **ample assets** to fund ages 65-70
- Delaying maximizes government income (efficient source)
- Reduces need for taxable withdrawals later

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Keep CPP/OAS delay strategy** (age 70 is optimal for this case)

## Tax Analysis

### Lifetime Tax Burden

| Period | Tax Paid | Income | Effective Rate |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Year 1-10** | $202,518 | $2,221,081 | 9.1% |
| **Year 11-20** | $168,739 | $2,449,287 | 6.9% |
| **Year 21-30** | $150,533 | $1,996,609 | 7.5% |
| **Total** | **$521,790** | **$6,666,977** | **7.8%** ✓ |

**Analysis**:
✅ Tax rate of 7.8% is **very low** (excellent tax efficiency)
✅ RRIF frontload strategy is minimizing OAS clawback
✅ Eligible dividend tax credits are working effectively

**Why so low?**
- RRIF withdrawals taxed at low rates (minimal other income)
- Corporate eligible dividends receive dividend tax credit
- Non-registered distributions taxed favorably (50% cap gains inclusion, dividend credits)
- Income splitting between Juan and Daniela
- Age credit and pension credit reducing tax

### Marginal Tax Rates

**Current marginal rates** (both showing 0% in early years - likely data issue):

Should be closer to:

| Income Level | Federal | Provincial (AB) | Combined |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| $0 - $55,867 | 15% | 10% | 25% |
| $55,868 - $111,733 | 20.5% | 12% | 32.5% |
| $111,734 - $173,205 | 26% | 13% | 39% |
| $173,206 - $246,752 | 29% | 14% | 43% |
| $246,753+ | 33% | 15% | 48% |

**Estimated actual marginal rates** (based on income):

| Year | Total Income | Est. Marginal Rate |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2026 | ~$130,000 | ~32.5% |
| 2030 | ~$145,000 | ~39% |
| 2035 | ~$160,000 | ~39% |

**Effective rate is 7.8%** because:
- Basic personal amount: $15,705 × 2 = $31,410 tax-free
- Age credit: ~$7,898 × 2 = $15,796 tax reduction
- Pension credit: ~$2,000 × 2 = $4,000 tax reduction
- Dividend tax credits: ~$40,000 tax reduction over 30 years
- Capital gains inclusion: Only 50% taxable

**Recommendation**: ✅ Tax efficiency is excellent - no changes needed

## Recommendations Summary

### Priority 1: Reduce Investment Return Assumptions 🔴

**Current**: 5-6% nominal returns (3-4% real)
**Recommended**: 3-4% nominal returns (1-2% real)

**Rationale**:
- More realistic for conservative portfolio (cash, GIC, bonds)
- Accounts for investment fees, taxes, inflation
- Reduces unrealistic estate growth

**Impact**: Estate would grow to ~$6-7M instead of $12M

---

### Priority 2: Increase TFSA Withdrawals 🔴

**Current**: $0 TFSA withdrawals over 30 years
**Recommended**:
- Age 70-75: $20,000/year
- Age 76-85: $30,000/year
- Age 86-95: $50,000/year

**Rationale**:
- TFSA withdrawals are 100% tax-free
- Using TFSA reduces need for taxable withdrawals
- Prevents TFSA from ballooning to $2.87M (wasted tax efficiency)

**Impact**:
- Reduce TFSA balance from $2.87M to ~$500k at age 95
- Save ~$50,000 in lifetime taxes
- Better cash flow management

---

### Priority 3: Draw Down Corporate Balance 🔴

**Current**: $94,624/year average withdrawals
**Recommended**:
- Age 66-70: $150,000/year (+$60k increase)
- Age 71-80: $180,000/year (+$70k increase)
- Age 81-90: $200,000/year (+$80k increase)

**Rationale**:
- Corporate assets taxed at ~50% at death
- Paying eligible dividends now = ~30% tax
- Every $100k withdrawn saves $20k in estate tax

**Impact**:
- Reduce corporate balance from $5.25M to ~$500k
- Save ~$800,000 in estate taxes
- Increase after-tax legacy to beneficiaries

---

### Priority 4: Increase Non-Registered Principal Withdrawals 🟡

**Current**: $0 principal withdrawals (only distributions)
**Recommended**: $30,000/year starting age 70

**Rationale**:
- Realize capital gains at lower tax rates during lifetime
- Avoid large tax hit at death (50% marginal rate vs. 30% during life)

**Impact**:
- Save ~$45,000 in lifetime taxes
- Reduce estate tax burden by $150,000

---

### Priority 5: Increase Spending (If Desired) 🟢

**Current**: $204,840/year average (4.9% withdrawal rate)
**Recommended**: Consider 6-7% spending rate

**Rationale**:
- Portfolio is growing faster than spending
- More enjoyment during "go-go" years
- Reduces future estate tax burden

**Options**:
- Increase go-go spending from $153,700 to $200,000
- Add one-time expenses (travel, gifts, home renovations)
- Consider charitable giving or gifts to children

**Impact**:
- Enhance quality of life during retirement
- Reduce estate size (less tax at death)
- Provide financial help to family earlier

---

### Priority 6: Enforce RRIF Frontload Strategy 🟢

**Current**: 15% before OAS (✓), 7.7% after OAS (✗ should be 8%)
**Recommended**: Enforce 8% minimum after OAS starts

**Rationale**:
- RRIF frontload strategy designed to minimize OAS clawback
- Current implementation is under-withdrawing after age 70
- RRIF balance should be nearly depleted by age 85-90

**Impact**:
- Accelerate RRIF depletion
- Reduce taxable estate
- Minimize estate tax at death

## Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Next Simulation Run)

1. **Adjust return assumptions**:
   ```
   Juan NonReg: 5% → 3.5%
   Daniela NonReg: 6% → 4%
   Juan Corp: 5% → 4%
   Daniela Corp: 5% → 4%
   TFSA: Use explicit rate of 4-5% (not 7.3%)
   ```

2. **Add TFSA withdrawal schedule**:
   ```
   Age 70-75: $20,000/year
   Age 76-85: $30,000/year
   Age 86+: $50,000/year
   ```

3. **Increase corporate withdrawals**:
   ```
   Age 66-70: $150,000/year (currently $64k-$97k)
   Age 71-80: $180,000/year (currently $103k-$135k)
   Age 81-90: $200,000/year
   ```

4. **Add non-registered principal withdrawals**:
   ```
   Age 70+: $30,000/year principal (in addition to distributions)
   ```

5. **Verify RRIF frontload enforcement**:
   ```
   Age 66-69: 15% of RRIF balance
   Age 70+: 8% of RRIF balance (minimum)
   ```

### Expected Results After Changes

| Metric | Current | Recommended | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ending Estate** | $11,925,390 | ~$6,500,000 | -$5.4M |
| **Estate Tax** | $1,266,170 | ~$650,000 | -$616k |
| **After-Tax Legacy** | $10,659,221 | ~$5,850,000 | -$4.8M |
| **TFSA at 95** | $2,866,067 | ~$500,000 | -$2.4M |
| **Corp at 95** | $5,247,988 | ~$500,000 | -$4.7M |
| **Lifetime Tax** | $521,790 | ~$750,000 | +$228k |
| **Lifetime Spending** | $6,145,185 | ~$7,500,000 | +$1.4M |

**Net Impact**:
- ✅ More realistic estate outcome ($6.5M vs $12M)
- ✅ Higher lifetime spending (+$1.4M)
- ✅ Lower estate tax (-$616k)
- ✅ Slightly higher lifetime tax (+$228k, but worth it for $1.4M more spending)

**After-tax benefit**: +$1.4M spending - $0.23M tax = **+$1.17M net benefit to Juan & Daniela**

## Conclusion

The current simulation shows **unrealistic portfolio growth** due to:

1. ✗ Investment returns too high (5-6% vs realistic 3-4%)
2. ✗ TFSA untouched for 30 years (balloons to $2.87M)
3. ✗ Corporate account under-utilized (grows to $5.25M)
4. ✗ Non-registered principal never withdrawn (grows to $3.76M)
5. ✗ Spending too conservative (4.9% withdrawal rate)

**The math doesn't work**: You cannot spend $205k/year, withdraw $95k/year, and grow from $4.2M to $12M over 30 years unless investment returns are extraordinarily high (which is unrealistic for a conservative retiree portfolio).

### Recommended Solution

1. **Reduce return assumptions** to 3-4% (more realistic)
2. **Increase TFSA withdrawals** to $20k-$50k/year
3. **Increase corporate withdrawals** to $150k-$200k/year
4. **Add non-registered principal withdrawals** of $30k/year
5. **Consider increasing spending** if lifestyle permits

**Result**: Estate of ~$6.5M (more realistic) with $1.4M more lifetime spending and $616k less estate tax.
