Subject: RetireZest Update - RRSP/RRIF Fixes Completed

Dear Stacy,

We're pleased to inform you that we've completed the fixes for the RRSP and RRIF functionality in RetireZest. The system is now working correctly.

Important note about RRSP withdrawals: To withdraw from your RRSP before age 71, the funds need to be converted and allocated to the RRIF asset first. This ensures proper tax treatment and withdrawal calculations.

The updates are now live on the platform. Please log in and try running your simulation again to see if everything is working as expected.

Additionally, we've added 10 simulation tokens to your account to help you test the fixes and explore the updated features.

Thank you for your patience while we resolved these issues. Please let us know if the fix works for you or if you encounter any other issues.

Best regards,
The RetireZest Team
