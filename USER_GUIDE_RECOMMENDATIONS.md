## First-Time User Workflow

### Goal: Get Your First Baseline Retirement Plan (30-45 minutes)

#### Phase 1: Set Up Your Profile (5-10 min)
**Navigation:** Profile → Personal Information

1. **Basic Information**
   - Enter your name and date of birth
   - Select your province of residence
   - If married/partnered, enable "Include Partner in Planning"
   - Add partner's name and date of birth

**Why This Matters:** Your age determines government benefit eligibility, and province affects tax calculations.

---

#### Phase 2: Add Your Assets (10-15 min)
**Navigation:** Profile → My Assets

**Start Simple - Add Main Account Balances:**

1. **Registered Accounts**
   - RRSP balance (pre-tax retirement savings)
   - RRIF balance (if you've already converted RRSP)
   - TFSA balance (tax-free savings)
   - TFSA contribution room available

2. **Non-Registered Accounts**
   - Investment accounts (taxable)
   - Cash savings
   - GICs

3. **Corporate Accounts** (if applicable)
   - Business investment accounts

**Don't Worry About:**
- Exact asset allocation (cash/GIC/equity splits) - defaults are reasonable
- Precise Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) - the system estimates 80%
- Yield assumptions - defaults are conservative

**Tips:**
- Round numbers are fine (e.g., $500,000 vs $497,234.56)
- Focus on getting major assets in - you can refine later
- Use recent statements (within last 3 months)

---

#### Phase 3: Estimate Government Benefits (10 min)
**Navigation:** Benefits → CPP Calculator & OAS Calculator

**CPP Estimation:**
1. Use the CPP Calculator
2. Enter your average annual income and years of contributions
3. Choose CPP start age (default: 65, consider 70 for higher benefits)
4. Note the estimated monthly amount

**Important:** Visit [Service Canada My Account](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html) for accurate CPP contribution history.

**OAS Estimation:**
1. Use the OAS Calculator
2. Enter years lived in Canada after age 18
3. Choose OAS start age (65-70)
4. Note the estimated monthly amount

**GIS (Guaranteed Income Supplement):**
- Automatically calculated based on your retirement income
- Only applicable if income is below thresholds
- No input needed from you

---

#### Phase 4: Set Spending Goals (5 min)
**Navigation:** Simulation → Household Settings → Spending Phases

**Three Life Phases:**

1. **Go-Go Years (Active Retirement)**
   - Typical: 65-75 years old
   - Higher spending (travel, hobbies, activities)
   - **Recommendation:** 70-90% of pre-retirement income
   - Example: $60,000/year

2. **Slow-Go Years (Reduced Activity)**
   - Typical: 75-85 years old
   - Moderate spending (less travel, more home-based)
   - **Recommendation:** 60-70% of Go-Go spending
   - Example: $45,000/year

3. **No-Go Years (Limited Mobility)**
   - Typical: 85+ years old
   - Lower spending but higher healthcare costs
   - **Recommendation:** 50-60% of Go-Go spending
   - Example: $40,000/year

**Starting Point:** If unsure, use current annual spending as Go-Go amount.

---

#### Phase 5: Run Your First Simulation (5 min)
**Navigation:** Simulation

**Simple Setup:**
1. Verify auto-populated data from your profile
2. Leave withdrawal strategy as **"Balanced"** (good default)
3. Click **"Run Simulation"**

**What to Look For:**
1. **Health Score** (top right)
   - 80-100: Excellent - plan is solid
   - 60-79: Good - minor adjustments needed
   - Below 60: Needs attention - may run out of money

2. **Years Funded**
   - Should show "Fully funded" if successful
   - If not, note which year money runs out

3. **Final Estate**
   - What's left for heirs
   - Zero is OK if that's your goal

**Red Flags:**
- Spending gaps in early retirement years
- Running out of money before age 90
- Extremely high tax burden (>30% effective rate)

---

#### Phase 6: Review Results (5-10 min)
**Navigation:** Simulation → Results Tab

**Key Sections to Review:**

1. **Summary Dashboard**
   - Total tax paid over retirement
   - Government benefits received
   - Net worth trajectory

2. **Portfolio Chart**
   - Should gradually decrease over time
   - Watch for sudden drops (bad sign)
   - Should not hit zero before age 90-95

3. **Tax Chart**
   - Annual tax burden
   - Look for tax spikes (opportunities to optimize)

4. **Year-by-Year Table**
   - Click rows to expand detail
   - Review early years (age 65-70) and late years (85+)
   - Check: Are government benefits starting when expected?

**Export Your Results:**
- Click "Export CSV" for detailed spreadsheet analysis

---

#### Phase 7: (Optional) Try One Simple Scenario (10 min)
**Navigation:** Scenarios

**Easy First Scenarios to Try:**

1. **Load Current Plan**
   - Creates your baseline scenario

2. **Quick What-If Options:**
   - "Delay CPP to 70" - see impact of waiting
   - "Increase spending by 10%" - test sustainability
   - "Maximize TFSA contributions" - see tax savings

3. **Compare Results**
   - Select 2-3 scenarios (click cards)
   - Review comparison table
   - Focus on: Years Funded, Total Tax, Final Estate

**Decision Making:**
- Green Health Score (80+) → Plan is working
- Compare total tax paid → Lower is better
- Check years funded → Must be fully funded

2. **OAS Clawback Avoidance**
   - Threshold: ~$90,000 net income (2025)
   - Withdraw RRIF before age 72 to reduce future RMDs
   - Use TFSA contributions to lower taxable income

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### For All Users:

1. **Underestimating Longevity**
   - ❌ Planning to age 85
   - ✅ Plan to age 95 minimum (50% chance of living past 90)

2. **Ignoring Inflation**
   - ❌ Using today's dollar amounts for future spending
   - ✅ Account for 2-3% annual inflation

3. **Overestimating Government Benefits**
   - ❌ Assuming maximum CPP ($1,433/month)
   - ✅ Use Service Canada estimates

4. **Forgetting Required Minimum Withdrawals**
   - ❌ Ignoring RRIF minimums after 72
   - ✅ Simulator accounts for this automatically

5. **Not Planning for Healthcare**
   - ❌ Assuming costs stay flat
   - ✅ Increase No-Go spending for medical needs

6. **Focusing Only on Taxes**
   - ❌ Minimizing taxes at expense of lifestyle
   - ✅ Balance tax efficiency with spending goals

### For First-Time Users:

7. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - ❌ Trying to get everything perfect before first run
   - ✅ Start with rough numbers, refine later

8. **Ignoring the Baseline**
   - ❌ Jumping straight to scenarios
   - ✅ Establish baseline plan first

### For Experienced Users:

9. **Over-Optimization**
   - ❌ Chasing 0.5% tax savings
   - ✅ Focus on major levers (CPP timing, withdrawal strategy)

10. **Forgetting Real Life**
    - ❌ Creating perfect plan that's impractical
    - ✅ Ensure strategy is executable and flexible

## Best Practices

### Data Management

1. **Keep Profile Updated**
   - Review quarterly
   - Update after major life events
   - Recalculate after market changes

2. **Document Assumptions**
   - Use scenario names with details
   - Keep notes on why certain choices made
   - Track changes over time

3. **Regular Reviews**
   - Annual: Full re-run of baseline
   - Quarterly: Quick check on assumptions
   - After major changes: New scenarios

### Scenario Discipline

1. **Naming Convention**
   - Use descriptive names: "CPP70-OAS67-RRIFFrontload"
   - Include date: "Baseline-2025-Q1"
   - Version control: "Optimized-v3"

2. **Limit Active Scenarios**
   - Keep 8-10 scenarios max

   - Change one variable at a time initially
   - Combine winners later

### Decision Framework

**Use This Hierarchy:**

1. **Survival** - Will money last?
   - Must achieve 100% years funded
   - Non-negotiable

2. **Lifestyle** - Can I afford my desired spending?
   - Prioritize Go-Go years
   - Accept reduced Slow-Go/No-Go if needed

3. **Tax Efficiency** - Minimize tax drag
   - Secondary to survival and lifestyle
   - Optimize within constraints

4. **Estate** - What's left for heirs?
   - Only after above are satisfied
   - Balance with living well now

Your goal is to get a reasonable baseline plan and understand if your retirement is viable. Don't get overwhelmed by all the options - start simple and add complexity as you learn.

**Experienced Users:**
Your goal is to optimize across multiple dimensions: tax efficiency, spending sustainability, estate planning, and lifestyle goals. Use the full power of scenario analysis to find the best strategy.

**For Everyone:**
Remember that this is a planning tool. Real life rarely follows the plan exactly. Build in margin for error, stay flexible, and update regularly. The best plan is one you can understand, explain, and execute.

**Key Takeaway:** A good-enough plan executed is better than a perfect plan that never gets implemented.
